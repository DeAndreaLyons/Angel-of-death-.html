<b><h3>About Rachel Gardner</h3></b>

<p>Ray was raised by her mother and father. Her mother was unemployed, while her father was a police officer. Her parents despised each other, and it is implied they would argue at least every night. Her mother implies that she is the only reason the two are remaining together. However, the couple did not attempt to spare Ray in their feuding, blaming each other for her lack of empathy, as well as verbally and physically abusing her.

Her father would spend most of the family money on alcohol (the fuel for many firefights) and prostitutes, and as a result, her house was in poor condition, leaving empty bottles of spirits around the house, leaving bills unpaid, and appliances and floors unfixed. As such, Ray spent most of her time out of the house, wandering alleys. While it is not stated if she went to school, it can be assumed she did, as she can read, write, and understand basic chemistry.</p>
